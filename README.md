Stimuli, data, and analysis scripts for APG non-adjacent dependency learning study (Zettersten, Potter, and Saffran)

## Data

The folder data contains the following documents

- **APG_data.txt**: The complete data set
- **AOG_analysis.R**: An R script documenting all analyses included in the manuscript
- **APG_analysis.Rmd**: An R markdown file documenting the central models reported in the manuscript
- **APG_analysis.html**: The R markdown file exported as an html (if you only want to inspect the models and their summary outputs rather than reproduce the analyses in R)
- **APG_codebook.txt**: A codebook for the dataset "APG_data.txt"
- **summarizeData.R**: An R script including help functions to summarize data

## Analysis Walkthrough

Here is a direct link to the html output of the R Markdown file in the data folder. This provides a walkthrough of the major analyses in the paper.
