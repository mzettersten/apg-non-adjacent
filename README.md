## Data & Analysis

The folder data_analysis contains the following documents

- **APG_data.txt**: The complete data set
- **APG_analysis.R**: An R script documenting all analyses included in the manuscript
- **APG_analysis.Rmd**: An R markdown file documenting the central models reported in the manuscript
- **APG_analysis.html**: The R markdown file exported as an html (if you only want to inspect the models and their summary outputs rather than reproduce the analyses in R)
- **APG_codebook.txt**: A codebook for the dataset "APG_data.txt"

## Analysis Walkthrough

Here is a direct link to the html rendering of the R Markdown file in the data folder. This provides a walkthrough of the major analyses in the paper.

## Stimuli

The stimuli folder contains all stimuli used across the three experiments (pre-exposure, exposure and test stimuli).

## Figures

The figures folder contains the main results figures reported in the manuscript.
