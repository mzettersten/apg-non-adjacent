**Abstract**

Non-adjacent dependencies are ubiquitous in language, but difficult to learn in artificial language experiments in the lab. Previous research suggests that non-adjacent dependencies are more learnable given structural support in the input â€“ for instance, in the presence of high variability between dependent items. However, not all non-adjacent dependencies occur in supportive contexts. How are such regularities learned? One possibility is that learning one set of non-adjacent dependencies can highlight similar structures in subsequent input, facilitating the acquisition of new non-adjacent dependencies that are otherwise difficult to learn. In three experiments, we show that prior exposure to learnable non-adjacent dependencies - i.e., dependencies presented in a learning context that has been shown to facilitate discovery - improves learning of novel non-adjacent regularities that are typically not detected. These findings demonstrate how the discovery of complex linguistic structures can build on past learning in supportive contexts.

## Data & Analysis

The folder data_analysis contains the following documents

- **APG_data.txt**: The complete data set
- **APG_analysis.R**: An R script documenting all analyses included in the manuscript
- **APG_analysis.Rmd**: An R markdown file documenting the central models reported in the manuscript
- **APG_analysis.html**: The R markdown file exported as an html (if you only want to inspect the models and their summary outputs rather than reproduce the analyses in R)
- **APG_codebook.txt**: A codebook for the dataset "APG_data.txt"
